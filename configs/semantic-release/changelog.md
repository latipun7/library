### ‚ú® Features

- **releaserc:** disable mentions in changelog [`76d1e85`](https://github.com/latipun7/library/commit/76d1e85ce846354f06749b8b2c70571625470246).

  Leveraging GitHub release's contributors, now disabling mentions in
  changelog, since it's a little buggy too (detecting user mentions when
  mentioning scoped package name).

## [@latipun7/releaserc-v2.0.0](https://github.com/latipun7/library/compare/@latipun7/releaserc@1.0.0...@latipun7/releaserc@2.0.0) (2021-10-04)

### ‚ö† BREAKING CHANGES

- **deps:** The minimum required version of node is now v14.17.

  This is a maintenance release. An increasing amount of dependencies
  required a node version higher than the Node 10 version supported by
  `semantic-release@17`. We decided to go straight to a recent Node LTS
  version because the release build is usually independent of others,
  requiring a higher node version is less disruptive to users, but helps us
  reduce the maintenance overhead.
